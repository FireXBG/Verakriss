Professional Summary

I am a 20-year-old with a lifelong passion for technology. My journey in web development began with a curiosity about HTML, CSS, evolving into a dedicated study of JS. I have successfully completed projects utilizing diverse technologies and tools such as Firebase.
Currently, I am focused on advancing my skills in NodeJS for back-end development and React.

My goal is to discover a fitting professional environment where I can contribute meaningfully to both the company and the team.

Additionally, I am eager to broaden my knowledge by exploring the intricacies of the Stripe API and delving into TypeScript in the future.

In terms of my personality:

I harbor a deep love for software and find genuine excitement in updates, be it for a favorite application or the software on my phone. Music plays a significant role in my life, acting as a catalyst for productivity and focus, especially when I am immersed in the work of my favorite artists. Engaging in discussions on global topics, such as the development of Neuralink or geopolitics, is another aspect of my personality that I thoroughly enjoy.
